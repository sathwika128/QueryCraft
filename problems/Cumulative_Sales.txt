Consider the following tables in a database:



Input:

Table Name 1: Products



ProductID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each product.
ProductName: Name of the product.
CategoryID (Foreign Key): Identifier linking the product to its category.
Unit: Measurement unit in which the product is sold.
Price: Price of the product.


Table Name 2: Order_Details



OrderID (Foreign Key): Identifier linking the order to a specific order in the Orders table.
ProductID (Foreign Key): Identifier linking the order to a specific product in the Products table.

Table Name 3: Orders



OrderID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each order.
CustomerID (Foreign Key): Identifier linking the order to a specific customer in the Customers table.
EmployeeID (Foreign Key): Identifier linking the order to a specific employee in the Employees table.

Using the Shippers, orders, orderdetails, and Products tables, write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (rounded up to 2 decimals) for each shipper by order date. Additionally, calculate the cumulative sales (rounded up to 2 decimals) for each shipper up to and including each order date.
