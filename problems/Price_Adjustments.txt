You have a table named Products with the following columns: ProductID, Category, and Price. Write an SQL query to calculate an adjusted price for each product based on its category. The adjusted price should be:



10% higher for products in the 'Electronics' category.
5% higher for products in the 'Books' category.
The same is true for the original price for all other categories.


The query should return the ProductID, Category, Price, and Adjusted Price for each product
