Your task is to write a query to determine the number of unique conversation threads in the messenger_sends table.

A unique conversation thread is defined as a unique pair of sender_id and receiver_id, where the direction of the message (who sent to whom) does not matter. In other words, the pair (1, 2) should be considered the same as (2, 1).

messenger_sends table:

Column Name	Description
sender_id	ID of the user sending the message
receiver_id	ID of the user receiving the message
Example Output:
unique_threads
5
