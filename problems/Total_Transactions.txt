Using the transaction data, create an SQL query to calculate the total number of transactions 
and the total transaction amount for each month and year. Filter the results to include only the top three months with the highest transaction volume. 
The returned table must contain year, month, TotalTransactions and TotalAmount column.

NOTE: The output format might not contain all the rows present in the returned table.
